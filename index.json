However, running deep learning models on mobile devices is generally challenging due to limitation of the available computing resources. It is common to let the users send their service requests to cloud servers that run the large-scale deep learning models to process. Sending the data associated with the service requests to the cloud, however, impose risks on the user data privacy. Some prior arts proposed sending the features extracted from raw data (e.g., images) to the cloud. Unfortunately, these extracted features can still be exploited by attackers to recover raw images and to infer embedded private attributes (e.g., age, gender, etc.). In this paper, we propose an adversarial training framework DeepObfuscator that can prevent extracted features from being utilized to reconstruct raw images and infer private attributes, while retaining the useful information for the intended cloud service (i.e., image classification). DeepObfuscator includes a learnable encoder, namely, obfuscator that is designed to hide privacy-related sensitive information from the features by performingour proposed adversarial training algorithm. Our experiments on CelebAdataset show that the quality of the reconstructed images fromthe obfuscated features of the raw image is dramatically decreased from 0.9458 to 0.3175 in terms of multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM). The person in the reconstructed image, hence, becomes hardly to be re-identified. The classification accuracy of the inferred private attributes that can be achieved by the attacker drops down to a random-guessing level, e.g., the accuracy of gender is reduced from 97.36% to 58.85%. As a comparison, the accuracy of the intended classification tasks performed via the cloud service drops by only 2%","tags":[],"title":"DeepObfuscator: Adversarial Training Framework for Privacy-Preserving Image Classification","type":"publication"}]
